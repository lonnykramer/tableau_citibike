Data was pulled from the Citibike NYC website with Q1 and Q2 from 2017, 2018, 2019 and the entire month of activity from 201910.  Various
trends were compared and visualizations were built to compare quarters, sales, station usage, and age of customers.

Additional analysis into months, instead of quarters, may have revealed hidden trends.
